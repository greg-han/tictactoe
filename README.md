## Tic Tac Toe
Pretty self explanatory.
My attempt at making a tic tac toe game with a rudimentary AI.
Purposefully did not use any outside resources for planning the AI strategy so that I can practice and implement what I had learned in school.
It turned out meh, but it has legitimately beat me once lol.

Uses MRV/LCV depending on if it gets the center square. If it has the center square, it will be on the offense and use MRV. If it does not, then it will use LCV and play defensively. Sometimes it will just not get position at all. This is from the built in randomness. I put in the randomness so that you don't just lose/draw everytime.
