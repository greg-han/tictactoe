## Tic Tac Toe
Pretty self explanatory.
My attempt at making a tic tac toe game.

Update 3/14/18: Initial Commit. Literally just started this and designed the layout. So far, the general (In English) logic for the game is thought out.
Will be using constraint satisfaction. At the moment considering just using MRV and LCV with a single condition before.
Posting this early so that I can commit, add, push, etc. as i'm working on it.

## Features

* Start: Starts the game.
* Refresh: Starts the game over/stops the game. This may change to "stop" with the same functionality.
* X/O : Just a selector for player.
